-- Setup instructions.

You will need:

1. Apache with mod_ssl support.
        See http://www.modssl.org

2. PHP with mcrypt and MySQL support.
        See http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mcrypt.php

3. MySQL. 
        See http://www.mysql.com


Configuring the above is beyond the scope of this documentation. Each of the
referenced sites should give you enough information to get going.

Step 1:

Create a database in MySQL and install the db.sql file into it:

mysql -u<user> -p <database name> < db.sql

Step 2:

Edit the file inc/db.php and configure the username, password and database
name. Optionally, if your MySQL server is not localhost, modify the host here
as well.

Step 3:

Move all the files to location of your SSL configured website. Go to the site
in your browser and verify that everything works. Create a user. Login. Create
some categories. Try making an entry in the database. Make sure you are able
to retrieve it. (NOTE! Passwords are hidden from the screen by default, to
prevent people reading over your shoulder. To display the password for an 
entry, move the mouse over the password field for that entry.)

-- Known problems.

There's no way to prevent anyone from creating a new login. The site you setup
is effectively public. To work around this, either use .htaccess files to 
restrict access to the site, or remove the newlogin.php file once you've
created logins.

If more than 24 entries exist in a category, the HTML of the page messes up.
Various options exist to prevent this, such as 'tab'ifying the data, or simply
changing the page style to allow unlimited vertical growth. It's not yet been
a big enough of a problem for me that I've addressed it. If someone would like
to resolve this, feel free to submit a patch.
